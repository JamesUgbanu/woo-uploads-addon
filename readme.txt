WooCommerce Uploads Addon

== Description ==

WooCommerce Uploads Addon is a WooCommerce addon for enabling end users to upload custom image files before adding Products to Cart.

This feature helps store owners to capture additional information from their customers and helps saving considerable time in preparing the Order for customer without waiting for additional information that might be required. 

Through this plugin the end user or customer has to upload image files needed for store owners.

In the search field type "WooCommerce Uploads Addon" and click Search Plugins. Once you've found our plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

The manual installation method involves downloading our eCommerce plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).
